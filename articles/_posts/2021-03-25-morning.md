2021 and I'm still struggling to find my YouTube videos in the morning. I already don't want to do physical exercises at 7am but on top of it, I need to find the videos I want to do. As usual, I decided to build something. It can't take much than 2 days worth of work, right?

I present to you my [Morning Routine](https://morning.oertel.fr) website.

No backend, all the data is stored locally on your browser. If you are interested to see how it is built, heads to the repo [boertel/morning-routine](https://github.com/boertel/morning-routine).
