After chatting with a co-worker about tech stacks and side projects, I came up with these rules to give a chance for my side projects:

## Think

_Write down the idea_, let it simmer for a few days, weeks or months. Architecture it in your head, find the pain points. Even give up if you don't have the need for it anymore.

## Goal

What is _the_ feature that will make you use the application?

For example, I want to write an application to help me practice my Spanish. The only feature I really need is to do ask me a question, and for me to answer it. Then once I can start using it, and I can add the extra features: suggestions, corrections, formatting, etc.

## Scope

### Small

_Explore a new tech stack_: try a new programming language or new framework

### Large

_Stick with your current tech stack but add new smaller libraries_. For example: drop tailwind and try a new styling library or try a new UI components library.

## Timeboxing

_Be able to build it in 1 week_. Not fully build but deployed and ready to use. Then iterate on it at a slower pace but never stop.

<br />
Then start having fun coding your idea.

After digging into my memories, I remembered this [Syntax podcast](https://syntax.fm/show/819/fun-and-profitable-side-projects-for-developers) that covers some and more of these rules about side projects.
