I've never made resolutions because I felt like I didn't need to make them on January 1st. I would make "resolutions" during the year. Why wait the New Year when I can act on them now.

But for some items, I never acted on. This article is to make me accountable!

1. **Thank people**. Read a nice blog, send a e-mail to the author to tell them. Use an open source project, send thanks, use a product, say thanks,
2. **Consume less but consumer better** in terms of online content,
3. and a last one that I haven't fully flush out just yet but it is related to area of focus at work. But first I want to write my 2023 [Brag Document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) and identify what I liked to work on this year, and then **focus on TBD areas**.
