_I started writing this post in 2016 but posting it jus now. I was always thinking to spend more time adding more and more items. But let's publish it first and then add more._

I've been living in California, USA since 2011 (7 years when writing this post). Here are the things that make me realize that I changed:

- I have a double shower curtain now
- As a pedestrian, I wait the green light before crossing the street
- I like automatic cars better than manuals
- I'm fine passing cars from the right side when driving
- I'm not surprised to drive more than 10 hours, and find it fairly close
- I'm wearing a helmet when riding my bike
- I'm scared when going to the doctor, not for my health but for my wallet
- I answer: "I'm from San Francisco" when asked where I'm from when traveling
- I don't put a space between a word and the exclamation/interrogation point!
- I'm more confortable with qwerty than azerty
- I know how to do éèáîï on a qwerty keyboard
- <span style="text-decoration: line-through">I almost ordered delivery food, once</span>. I ordered delivery food, twice
- I'm fine with bars and clubs closing at 2AM
- I'm used to AM and PM
- I'm used to others units too: fahrenheit, miles, inches, feet, pounds
- I eat with only a fork
- I eat with my left hand placed on my leg
- I can eat bigger portions
- My taste of food is slowly getting worse
- I'm eating spicy food
- I don't judge what people are wearing
- I switch from speaking French to English fairly easily
- I have trouble finding some words in French, my native language
- I have trouble explaining my job and talking about technical work in French
- It's a storm when there are three drops of rain
- I swear in English
- People call me and I call myself *Ben* instead of *Benjamin*
- I critize less and try to offer a solution if I do
- I understand and enjoy going to a baseball game as an entertaining events
