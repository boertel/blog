I'm intriguted to know where Humans are going. While traveling or commuting, we spent lot of time on our [smartphone](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/well/mind/the-phones-we-love-too-much.html) and [social medias](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/opinion/sunday/dont-let-facebook-make-you-miserable.html). What is the point? Showing off our incredible adventure? when we spent more time doing dishes[^1], escape our boring everyday life? This topic is definitely worth a blogpost on its own.

On a lighter note, I'm following closely React and obscessed with why are my components re-rendering themselves? does my code perfom well? You can read more about [React-only optimizations](https://flexport.engineering/optimizing-react-rendering-part-1-9634469dca02), a big surprise for this article is to **NOT** use arrow-bind function as props. And then extent to other [optimizations and performance tracking techniques](https://medium.com/dailyjs/react-is-slow-react-is-fast-optimizing-react-apps-in-practice-394176a11fba) such as how to use chrome dev tools, and redux (which I like a lot even if it can be cumbersome at times) and Mapbox wrote a [good explanation about how to handle redux in large web apps](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/redux-for-state-management-in-large-web-apps/).

Still a little bit about performances, but now at a lower level than Javascript, an explanation about [CPU Usage](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-05-09/cpu-utilization-is-wrong.html) and why it is wrong. Or on other dimension, I'm always on the lookup to optimize my workflow, thus improving my vim skills with [tabs](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/working-with-tabs/).

And to finish with a touch of humor, presidential French elections happened this month, Macron won. This is the [main reason](http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/french-annoyingly-retain-right-to-claim-intellectual-superiority-over-americans) or at least the one I think it is.
