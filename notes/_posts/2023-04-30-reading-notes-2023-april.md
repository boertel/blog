Slower month, and took a while to go through the podcast to extract what was important. By the way, as I'm listening podcasts, I'm taking screenshots to have a timestamp of the moment. So I guess I need an app, that goes through my photos, find the screenshots, find the podcast, find the timestamp, find the transcript, and I can extract it directly :D

### Article: "[Incentives and motivations – Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com/incentives-and-motivations)"

> They'll not stop doing what they do because they simply enjoy the process of creation. Those are the people who I personally like to follow because are the ones that usually make great and interesting content.

Great example is content created by [Beau Miles](https://www.youtube.com/@BeauMiles), and how YouTube got a piece of junk, you need to go there with a video or creator in mind, put your horse blinders on and not fall into the trap of watching pure junk.

### Article: "[The freedom loop](https://seths.blog/2023/04/the-freedom-loop/)"

> You can drive as fast as you want. But you are also responsible for not running over someone in a school zone…

Living in the USA, land of the free, freedom is in the center of the (political?) culture. And yet I still haven't figure out _what is freedom_. Freedom doesn't mean to whatever you want.

### Article: "[Why do ships use "port" and "starboard" instead of "left" and "right?"](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/port-starboard.html)"

Starboard from "steer" and "board", and "port" because that is the side facing the port/harbor

### Article: "[The crappy parts of engineering management – Mike Crittenden](https://critter.blog/2023/04/18/the-crappy-parts-of-engineering-management/)"

Balancing between full-time engineer and manager on the side. This hits home with:

> Good stuff you loss: Focus time
>
> Bad stuff you gain:
>
> - Being a communication middleman
> - Telling stakeholders we won’t build what they want at all (although a good product manager will shoulder a lot of this)

What can I do to get these back? or don't deal with it?

### Article: "[Offline Is Just Online With Extreme Latency - Jim Nielsen’s Blog](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/offline-is-online-with-extreme-latency/)"

Which lead to [Local-first software - Peter Van Hardenberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrPsyr8Ig6M) and the main point I extracted from it is to give up on fetching data from APIs, but more having a synchronous process: store data locally, and sync up with your cloud.

### Podcast: "[Episode 7 — Vika: Twelve Dropdowns in a Row — Full Stack Whatever](https://fullstackwhatever.com/episode/vika-twelve-dropdowns-in-a-row)"

The first thing they did before starting the company was to set their principles/values which I guess can be found on their [about](https://www.hiresuper.com/about) page.

### Podcast: "[Episode 8 — Linda Eliasen: Bricks and Mortar — Full Stack Whatever](https://fullstackwhatever.com/episode/linda-eliasen-bricks-and-mortar)"

This isn't verbatim transcription but notes I took while listening:

- No matters your seniority level you are responsible for both bricks (the cool stuff) and mortars (the boring stuff).
- Being more PM-y, try other mediums, writing the doc is boring, I'd rather do some design work. Try to have fun doing it.
