### Article: "[All your mainstream UI frameworks are lying to you](https://moonthought.github.io/posts/all-your-mainstream-ui-frameworks-are-lying-to-you/)"

It made me realize why I liked React. Maybe from having nightmare from using Angular and the `ng-` syntax, but if you know JavaScript, you know React: it relies on JavaScript basics to work: conditional uses `if`, loops uses `for-loop` or `map`.
