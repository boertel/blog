### Article: "[All your mainstream UI frameworks are lying to you](https://moonthought.github.io/posts/all-your-mainstream-ui-frameworks-are-lying-to-you/)"

A different take on UI frameworks for the web. It takes a look at React, Svelte and Vue and how they are creating their own syntax to render content. And propose a theorical way to code with a DOM approach that aligns with something like Swift UI.
It made me realize why I liked React. Maybe from having nightmare from using Angular and the `ng-` syntax, but if you know JavaScript, you know React: it relies on JavaScript basics to work: conditional uses `if`, loops uses `for-loop` or `map`.

### Article: "[Can You Customize my Startup's Login Page?](https://ph-uhl.com/can-you-customize-my-startup-s-login-page/)" by Philipp Uhl

> Because, having a non-perfect login page, having a non-perfect presentation, is a good sniff test if your product is actually good enough. If your customer wants it even with that generic sign up, that's a good sign!

### Article: "[Bigger isn't better: the companies scale dilemma](https://adrianmato.com/blog/industry/opinion/bigger-isnt-better-companies-scale-dilemma/)" by AdriÃ¡n Mato

> We need more companies doing fewer things, fewer features, and requiring fewer employees. Building high-quality software is fun when you have focus and a tight team.

It is coming a recurring theme of these notes, with articles talking about building better software. Maybe one answer is to define a small scope and do it well.
