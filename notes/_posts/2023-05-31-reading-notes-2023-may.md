### Article: "[The Dilbert Blog: The Day You Became A Better Writer](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html)"

> Your first sentence needs to grab the reader. Go back and read my first sentence to this post. I rewrote it a dozen times. It makes you curious.

and I'll avoid you one click, here is the first sentence:

> I went from being a bad writer to a good writer after taking a one-day course in “business writing.” I couldn’t believe how simple it was. I’ll tell you the main tricks here so you don’t have to waste a day in class.

### Article: "[The ongoing defence of frontend as a full-time job](https://christianheilmann.com/2023/05/09/the-ongoing-defence-of-frontend-as-a-full-time-job/)"

> Frontend developers are:
>
> - Browser performance experts
> - Cross platform development experts
> - Accessibility experts
> - Compliance knowledgeable
> - Design and Test department connected
> - Fiercely dedicated to the end user

and I would add frontend devs have to _accomodate with data provided/structured by the backend_.

### Article: "[Writing summaries is more important than reading more books — Andreas Fragner](https://www.andreasfragner.com/writing/writing-summaries)"

4 questions:

> - In 1-2 sentences, what is the book about as a whole?
> - What are the 3-4 central questions it tries to answer?
> - Summarize the answers in one paragraph each.
> - What are the most important things you have learned personally?

It also mentioned that it can also be used to write essays to structure the story flow. And it can help with me trying to write more, and be better at it by writing about a book to get a topic out of the box.

### Article: "[How positioning makes you stand out from the crowd | Swizec Teller](https://swizec.com/blog/how-positioning-makes-you-stand-out-from-the-crowd/)"

> Forget about the technologies you know. What do you do with those technologies? What's your favorite company type? What industry fulfills you? What company stage fires you up?
> If you can show a history of success in what you do, that's what your resumé should be all about.

### Article: "[Turning todos into tadas](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/todo-tada/)"

> I want to focus less on “this is what I have to check off for the day” to feel like I have things managed and under control, and more on, “these are the things I did today, tada!”

### Photos: "[SF fog appreciation post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/13tdhhq/sf_fog_appreciation_post/)"

Not reading per se. Being in San Francisco and the foggy weather, it gives me inspiration that you don't need light/sun to take good pictures.

### Article: "[They Knew Little About Oysters. Now They Have a Farm With 2 Million.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/26/realestate/little-ram-oyster-long-island.html)"

For when AI took over programming and I need a new career!
