I'm Benjamin Oertel, in my early twenty's. Originally from France (more precisely from Nantes) and I'm currently working at <a href="//www.punchtab.com" target="_blank">PunchTab</a> in Palo Alto. I've being working for them since one year and a half<!-- and I decided to do a <a href="/rewards.html">custom implementation</a> of a loyalty program to show you what can be done with one of our product and technology-->.

I'm a software engineer using vim, git and some weird commands on a <span style="color: #0f0; background-color: #000;font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;screen&nbsp;</span> to write code, mainly *Javascript* and *Python* and the usual annoying couple: html/css. I often practice the [Aha! effect](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect) while programming while eating giant cookies even if I stopped eating them since our office moved to Palo Alto :(
