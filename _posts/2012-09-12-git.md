### GitHub Pages

I'm already hosting my personal website [ben.oertel.fr](//ben.oertel.fr) on GitHub through the [pages](//pages.github.com/) feature. It's really convinent: no server to maintain, it's free and files handled with my favorite versioning system: git, you push on github, it's live in the next few minutes (you could even update the content on github website directly in case you are not on your computer). Also my website has nothing to hide, it is only static content (html, css and javascript) so it's already viewable for everybody through the source code and the traffic is very light, I don't need a powerful backend behind it. Here are the main reasons I decided to switch to github as my hosting solution.

### Jekyll

Since I'm happy with it, I've pushed a little bit more the experiment by powering this blog with [Jekyll](//github.com/mojombo/jekyll), another technology that works on github (well, it has been created by one of Github's founder). At first, I was reluctant to use Jekyll: it was done in ruby (I consider myself as a javascript/python guy) and complicated to setup: what is this ```gem``` command? create folders after that and code everything after. But here it's my blog running on Jekyll after a hour of configuration (5 minutes to have something running and 55 minutes to customize css & html). Markdown

### Post-commit

Everything started with this piece of code: [coderwall.com/p/xlatfq](//coderwall.com/p/xlatfq), I saw that and I was like: "*I want to do the same*". I'm running this script for two months (waouh I didn't realize until now that it has been so long). After about a month, it results to this:

<object width="575" height="430"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"></param><param name="movie" value="https://www.facebook.com/v/10150885673412167"></param><embed src="https://www.facebook.com/v/10150885673412167" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="1" width="575" height="430"></embed></object>

And then, it was not enough, I decide to tweet everytime I'm commiting, and the user [git push my-face](//www.twitter.com/gitpushmyface) got created.
