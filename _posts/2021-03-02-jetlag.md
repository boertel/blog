There are plenty of apps to display timezones but I made that one. There isn't really anything revolutionary about it but I made that one. So why did I made it?
I've been using: [worldtimebuddy.com](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/) for years, the design is outdated, it is limited to 4 locations, there are noise on the page (social media buttons, help, description) _and_ it doesn't persist your locations. I figured it would be a good experiment exercise to do instead of looking for an alternative.

First choosing technologies:
- [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) and [vercel](https://vercel.com): easy to get started, and fast deployment
- [spacetime](https://github.com/spencermountain/spacetime/) to deal with time and timezone. It isn't as complete as momentjs but it is good enough to show time "now"
- [mapbox](https://mapbox.com) to fetch GPS coordinates
- [railway](https://railway.app/) for redis

## What is good?
Leveraging URL parameters. In contrast with worldtimebuddy, jetlag is persisting your location choices directly in the URL, so refresh the page: your choices are the same, share the link with a coworker: they are seeing the exact same view as you. I think URLs are underated in webapps. My rules are to know if I should store parameters in the URL:
1. if I refresh, should the page be the same? yes
2. if I share the URL with someone, should that someone see the same thing as me?

If the answers is **yes** to one of these, then you probably want to put your parameter in the URL: hash, query, or path parameter.

It might break down, and depending on session context. I added one special keyword: `me` (or `here`) that uses your browser timezone. It was for sack of simplicity but then it breaks rule 2: if I share the link with someone that someone won't see the same page as me.
- If I share: [jetlag.oertel.fr/me/utc](https://jetlag.oertel.fr/me/utc) to share the UTC time with someone it makes sense. The other person will see their timezone compared to UTC
- but if I share: [jetlag.oertel.fr/me/Hong Kong](https://jetlag.oertel.fr/me/Hong%20Kong) with someone in Hong Kong, they will get twice the Hong Kong timezone. What I should have share is: [jetlag.oertel.fr/San Francisco/Hong Kong](https://jetlag.oertel.fr/San%20Francisco/Hong%20Kong). This could be fixed by adding a "share" button to offer the option of converting `me` into `San Francisco`).

## What can be better?

- select a time range
- autocomplete and select a location. Right now you need to be specific when looking for a city, otherwise it might default to the wrong one such as this example: [jetlag.oertel.fr/puerto escondido/puerto escondido, oaxaca](https://jetlag.oertel.fr/puerto%20escondido/puerto%20escondido,%20oaxaca). The first is in Brazil and the second in Mexico.
- better layout, I'm not sold on columns, maybe rows would be better?
