I'm inspired by [Jim Nielsen's Reading Notes](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/reading-notes-january/) to try to make my consumption of daily articles more useful. My hope into writing these monthly reading notes is to:

- Remember what I read. If I'm writing about it, it is more likely that I'll remember the important articles. Otherwise it'll disappear as the tab vanishes in my browser history.
- Be more concisous about what I'm reading, and simply asking myself if this article is worth going into my reading notes might trigger some thinking and reflexion.
- Digest and connect the articles by writing with my own words

So here is my first entry, and see you next month

### Article: ["Thoughts on RSS"](https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts-on-rss)

As I'm re-building my RSS reader, and never ending scrolling on social media, I feel more inclined into building some restrictive mechanisms.

> 1. Keep your feed under control
> 2. Avoid feeds that are too busy.
> 3. Disable all notifications from your RSS reader
> 4. Subscribe to content that is not time sensitive.

3 is a must for all notifications but direct messages from work (during work hours), friends, and family. Everything else can usually wait.

### Article: ["A touch-screen fridge? A seven-blade razor? Why is everything suddenly so complicated?"](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/01/a-touch-screen-fridge-a-seven-blade-razor-why-is-everything-suddenly-so-complicated)

Hilarious view on "innovation". Going from razor with 1 blade, to 2, to 3, to 5! and then 7, why?

> But what about innovation with no real purpose other than to drive sales?
> while my dictionary defines innovate as “to introduce something new”, it also, tellingly, has it as “to introduce novelties”.
> That is why I'm relectant to get into "smart home". I own 1 smart light bubble that ends up behaving like a regular light bubble that I can update over wifi, and turns off for a few seconds every so and then.

### Podcast: ["Rasmus Andersson: A Computer as a Paintbrush"](https://fullstackwhatever.com/episode/rasmus-andersson-a-computer-as-a-paintbrush)

When talking about [vercel](https://vercel.com):

> really at the core of what they are doing is performance, speed, I think that is why they are winning. not because they have a feature that no one else has. AWS has this feature.

### Article: ["Productive Procrastination"](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/productive-procrastination/)

> you'll 1) have something productive to show for it, and 2) be much more fit, rested, and ready to tackle that project at work. [...] rather than fight your penchant for procrastination, work with it.

### Article ["Good Enough"](https://manuelmoreale.com/good-enough)

This matches perfectly my williness to write more on this blog.

> choosing the perfect word, and rewriting the same sentence until it's perfect. I'd argue that a personal blog is not the place for that.
> Personal blogs to me are more like conversations

### Article ["Advice For Engineers, From A Manager"](https://marcorogers.com/blog/advice-for-engineers-from-a-manager)

Alongside other good points, here are the ones I would be on top of my list:

> - Give effective status updates.
> - Stay ahead of problems.
> - Learn what the true scope of the project needs to be.
> - Understand business timelines.
> - Collaborate on designs.
> - Learn the business.

### Podcast: ["Brian Lovin: It's all about having fun"](https://fullstackwhatever.com/episode/brian-lovin-its-all-about-having-fun)

Buidling the product following a feedback loop process:

> Monday, Tuesday: show stuff to customers. I onboard people manually. I ask every single person to screenshare. [...] Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, iterate on the product

Also mentioning having 30 minutes gap between each session with customers, make a tweak, and see if the flow is less confusing for the next person.

### Podcast: ["Pete Hunt: The no fun rule"](https://fullstackwhatever.com/episode/pete-hunt-the-no-fun-rule)

Do the job, then the title will be given to you.

> no one can give the title of Tech Lead or whatever, it is just a thing that you do and it gets recognized later. You get the label after doing it for a while.

> no fun rule. If you are having at work, you maybe shouldn't do that thing [...] If this project is fun, you have to pause and think about your own biases. You are probably bias that the project is impactful, and there is a decent chance there is something you should be doing it instead.

### Podcast: ["Today in Focus: Rewriting Roald Dahl"](https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2023/feb/27/rewriting-roald-dahl-podcast)

First podcast I listen to where I've seen Roald Dahl name popping up on my feed and it was a nice way to catch up on the topic. One fact learned during the podcast was that Roald Dahl wrote Charlie and the Chocolaterie and was antisemic.

> laughter doesn't always mean mockery

when talking about a character in a book being "fat"
