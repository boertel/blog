If you are googling your own name and that it is: *Benjamin Oertel*, you may end up on this blog post. I've been receiving e-mails from a person called: "Gunter Oertel" for more than a year now.

These e-mails are in German. With my 9 years of German study in school and Google Translate (one more useful than this other, I let you guess which one), I can understand that it's a grandpa writing to his grandson which I assume is also called *Benjamin Oertel* and his e-mail address must be similar to mine. I tried to answer with my broken German telling him that he got the wrong e-mail address, and ask a German friend to do the same with proper German. But unfortunately no luck so far :(

I'm publishing this on Internet now. Just in case somebody can help a grandfather to sent sweet e-mails to his grandson asking for vacation pictures or wishing him happy birthday.

If you feel like you can help, please, contact me at: <a href="mailto:benjamin.oertel@gmail.com">benjamin.oertel@gmail.com</a>

**Danke schön.**
