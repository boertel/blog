I'm learning Spanish, and it can be exhausting to be a software engineer because I can't just learn Spanish, I have to build something to help me learn (let's not get into the debate if I should rather spent the time into actually learning the language rather than building something...)

The latest lesson was about numbers. I remember when first moving in the US, understanding numbers was hard. I could roughly understand the order of magnitude, otherwise I would simply accept the person to repeat the number.

I learn best by writing, and writing, and writing again (I'm a visual learning).

Some interesting things I came across were:

- [SpeechSynthesis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) is actually well supported in various browsers
- French numbers are complicated (who would have guessed?) A lot of websites references the "traditional" way whereas a reform from 2020 tries to make more homogeneous. More [Nombres en fran√ßais, Orthographe de 1990](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nombres_en_fran%C3%A7ais#Orthographe_de_1990)
- It can be a good question to ask for interviews
