I don't have much meetings, usually _one_ 15-minutes standup every day and another 5 to 6 others spread out during the week.
It isn't enough to use a bloated calendar app like google calendar.

I find it hard to navigate my meetings:

- how long do I have until the next meeting?
- on which platform is the meeting happening?
- is it an internal meeting or with clients?
- how does my day look like?

Here is the UI I choose to answer these questions (still weighting my options on the color scheme)

As I started using Calva to manage my meeting, I wanted to go back into tracking my productivity aka a way to notice progress when I'm un-motivated.
I've noticed that having 3 daily tasks to complete gives me a clear path of what I need to do, and have a feeling of accomplishement once I'm done with
the 3 tasks.

At the end of the day, incomplete or postponed tasks are moved to the next day.

This tool isn't build to replace calendar or project management tools. It is to give me a sense of the day ahead at a glance.

I haven't been through Google verification step to activate the app, but you can shoot me an [e-mail](mailto:benjamin.oertel+calva@gmail.com) and I can add you as a tester.
Otherwise you can still checkout the website [calva.oertel.fr](https://calva.oertel.fr), there is a cool button that I'm pretty proud of.
