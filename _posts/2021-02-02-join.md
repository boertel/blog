I like `sql` and sometimes I go overboard by [normalizing my database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) maybe too much. At that point, I need to rely on `JOIN` to get the data what I want. Issue is that I never remember how the `JOIN`s work: `RIGHT JOIN`, `LEFT INNER JOIN`, `OUTER JOIN`, etc. I've had an image on my `~/Desktop/` for years.

It has been hanging on my Desktop since I've got a new laptop in 2015 (MacBook Pro 2015 FTW!). I just got a new laptop and it was time to decide: copy the file over the new ~/Desktop or not.

Since I'm trying to stick to build one thing a month for 2021: here we go! Let's build an interactive version of that image.
