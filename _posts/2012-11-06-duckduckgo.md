title: Duck as a search engine
published: true

Few weeks ago, I decided to say goodbye to an old virtual friend of mine: Google Search.
The main reason was that Google is tracking all my move on the Internet: search, e-mail, documents, photos and probably more I don't think of.

After watching this video, I changed my mind and decided to update my Google Chrome default search engine (I hope they don't track me through the browser, otherwise the change is pretty useless). Decision made, I had to choose a new search engine. I'm guessing the others (big) search engines such as [Bing](http://www.bing.com) and [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com) are doing exactly the same thing as Google: tracking your every moves. The video mentioned earlier was promoted by [DuckDuckGo](http://www.duckduckgo.com). It highlights the fact that it is not tracking users and don't change results depending on user. Also having an ancient history with ducks, I couldn't resist to update to use a duck as search engine.

At first (like most of changes), I didn't like it but I know I had to force myself for a couple of days, in order to get use to it, to adapt myself to years of Google use.

Here we go, twenty-ish days later, I feel ready to expose my throughts about [DuckDuckGo](http://www.duckduckgo.com).

## Cons

- *Images* search is absent. With DuckDuckGo, you need to do the search through others search engines with the prefix ```!gi``` for Google or ```!bi``` for Bing.
- *Internationalization*. Even if I'm doing most of my searchs in English, sometimes I need to search something on French and DuckDuckGo doesn't understand it.
- *Results* unfortunaletly are not as good as Google ones. For this blogpost I needed to get an TechCrunch article, I choose the following query: "*techcrunch yahoo next search engine*" not even a TechCrunch article on the [DuckDuckGo's result](http://duckduckgo.com/?q=techcrunch+yahoo+next+search+engine) and the article I was looking for is on [second position on Google](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=techcrunch%20yahoo%20next%20search%20engine).


## Pros

- *Favicons* increase my selection on the result page. I have my favorites websites where I know the content is useful and accurate. By seeing ![Stackoverflow favicon](http://icons.duckduckgo.com/i/www.stackoverflow.com.ico)![Django favicon](http://icons.duckduckgo.com/i/www.djangoproject.com.ico)![Wikipedia favicon](http://icons.duckduckgo.com/i/en.wikipedia.com.ico)![Github favicon](http://icons.duckduckgo.com/i/www.github.com.ico) I'm directly clicking on those links.
- *Shortcuts*. I'm a big fan on shortcuts and command-line. I'm using [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) and the terminal! Here is a list of all bang commands you can use: http://duckduckgo.com/bang.html
- *[Goodies](http://duckduckgo.com/goodies/)*. Experiment it by yourself, it's great! and even better you can even create yours: http://duckduckhack.com/. This [TechCrunch article](http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/28/why-the-future-of-search-may-look-more-like-yahoo-than-google/) is talking about why Yahoo is going to be the next search engine.
- Click area is much bigger
- *Think* more, since the results are sliglty worse than Google, you have to shoot right at the first time or instead of re-doing a search, just look for it in your memory.


My use of a search engine is mainly to search for programming information (my job is basically to copy/paste). DuckDuckGo doesn't do the difference with the results but with the features it provides, that's why I'm going to keep using it.
