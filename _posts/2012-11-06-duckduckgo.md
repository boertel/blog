Few weeks ago, I decided to say goodbye to an old virtual friend of mine: Google Search.
The main reason was that Google is tracking all my move on the Internet: search, e-mail, documents, photos. It was after watching this video: http://vimeo.com/51181384 that I changed my mind and decide to update my Google Chrome default search engine (I hope they don't track me through the browser, otherwise the change is pretty useless).

Now, I had to choose a new search engine. I'm guessing the others (big) search engines such as Bing and Yahoo are doing exactly the same thing as Google: tracking your every moves. 

The video I've mentioned earlier was promoted by DuckDuckGo. It highlights the fact that it is not tracking users and don't change results depending on user. Also having an ancient history with ducks, I couldn't resist to update to duckduckgo.

At first (like most of changes), I didn't like it but I know I have to stick to it for a couple of days, to get use to it, change my habits.

Here we go, twenty days later, I feel ready to expose my throughts about DuckDuckGo.

## Cons

- *Images* search is absent. It's convienent on Google to do a search and say: "I want to click on the "Images". With duckduckgo, you need to do the search through others search engines with the prefix ```!gi``` for Google or ```!bi``` for Bing.

- *English*. Even if I'm doing most of my searchs in English, sometimes I need to search something on French.

- *Results*. Search unfortunaletly not as good as Google. For this blogpost I needed to get an article on TechCrunch, here are the two results for the query: "techcrunch yahoo next search engine", not even one techcrunch article on the result for DuckDuckGo and it's the second result for Google.


## Pros

- *Favicons*. It increases my selection on the result page. I'm mainly doing computer/programming related searches, I have my favorites websites: stackoverflow, djangoprojects, python documentation, github, wikipedia. I know that what I'm looking for is going to be on one of this page. By seeing the ![Stackoverflow favicon](http://icons.duckduckgo.com/i/www.stackoverflow.com.ico)![Wikipedia favicon](http://icons.duckduckgo.com/i/en.wikipedia.com.ico)![Github favicon](http://icons.duckduckgo.com/i/www.github.com.ico) I directly click on the link.

- *Shortcuts*. I'm a big fan on shortcuts and command-line. I'm using [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) and the terminal! Here is a list of all bang commands you can use: http://duckduckgo.com/bang.html

- *[Goodies](http://duckduckgo.com/goodies/)*. Experiment it by yourself, it's great! and even better you can even create yours: http://duckduckhack.com/. This [TechCrunch article](http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/28/why-the-future-of-search-may-look-more-like-yahoo-than-google/) is talking about why Yahoo is going to be the next search engine.

- Click area is much bigger

- *Think* more, since the results are sliglty worse than Google, you have to shoot right at the first time or instead of re-doing a search, just look for it in your memory.


My use of a search engine is mainly to search for programming information (my job is basically to copy/paste). DuckDuckGo doesn't do the difference with the results but with the features it provides, that's why I'm going to keep using it.
