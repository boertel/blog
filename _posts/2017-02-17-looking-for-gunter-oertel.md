If you are googling your own name and that it is: *Benjamin Oertel*, you may end up on this blog post. I've been receiving e-mails from a person called: "Gunter Oertel" for more than a year now.

These e-mails are in German. With my 9 years of German study in school and Google Translate (one more useful than this other, I let you guess which one), I can understand that it's a grandpa writing to his grandson which I assume is also called *Benjamin Oertel* and his e-mail address must be similar to mine. I tried to answer with my broken German telling him that he got the wrong e-mail address, and ask a German friend to do the same with proper German. But unfortunately no luck so far :(

I'm publishing this on Internet now. Just in case somebody can help a grandfather to sent sweet e-mails to his grandson asking for vacation pictures or wishing him happy birthday.

If you feel like you can help, please, contact me at: <a href="mailto:benjamin.oertel@gmail.com">benjamin.oertel@gmail.com</a>

**Danke schön.**

### <a name="update"></a>Update <small>(February 19)</small>

This weekend, I tried to go one step further by sending messages to some *Benjamin Oertel*&nbsp;&nbsp;I could find on social networks. Here is the content of the message:

> Hi,
>
> My name is Benjamin Oertel, I'm French but living in San Francisco. I'm contacting you because for the past year, I've been receiving few emails from a grandfather named "Günter Oertel". I tried to explain to him with my broken German that I wasn't his grandson but he keeps sending my e-mails. So I decided to be on the lookout for his grandson, which I assume is also named "Benjamin Oertel" and have a similar e-mail address as mine: "benjamin.oertel@gmail.com". I'm kind of sad that his grandson doesn't received these emails and also that he is not receiving any answers from these emails.<br>
> If by any chance, your grandfather is Günter, please reply to this message so one grandfather can finally sent e-mails to his grandson.
>
> Thanks,
>
> Ben

Waiting for answers now...


### Update <small >(5 minutes after sending bunch of Facebook messages)</small>

I **FOUND** his grandson. Here is his answer:

> Hi Ben, thanks for contacting me. Günter is my grandfather and I am already in contact with him since I was born. He got a tablet a few years ago, but still has some problems using it sometimes. Sorry for that

We had a nice chat on Facebook (we actually both work in IT) and now, the plan is to forward Günter's e-mails to his grandson since I've got his e-mail address now. No more e-mails lost in the wild for Günter.
